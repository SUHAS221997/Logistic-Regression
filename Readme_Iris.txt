Iris Dataset - Logistic Regression:
This repository demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression for classifying the famous Iris dataset into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning, commonly used for classification tasks and model evaluation.

Overview:
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from 3 species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). Each sample has 4 features:
•	Sepal length
•	Sepal width
•	Petal length
•	Petal width
The goal is to classify each flower into one of the three species using Logistic Regression.

Requirements:
To run the code, you will need Python 3.x and the following packages:
•	numpy
•	pandas
•	scikit-learn
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
