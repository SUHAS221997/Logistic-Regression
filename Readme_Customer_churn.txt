Customer Churn Prediction Using Logistic Regression:
This repository demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression for predicting customer churn in a subscription-based service. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn (leave) or stay based on their demographic and usage data.

Overview:
Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over time, which is a crucial metric for businesses. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, businesses can take proactive measures to improve retention. In this project, we use Logistic Regression, a simple and effective binary classification algorithm, to predict customer churn.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains information about customers, including demographics, account information, and usage patterns, with the target variable indicating whether the customer churned (1) or stayed (0).
Dataset features include:
•	CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
•	Gender: Gender of the customer
•	Age: Age of the customer
•	Tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the service
•	ServiceUsage: Frequency or amount of service used
•	MonthlySpend: The amount the customer spends monthly
•	Churn: Target variable (1 = Churned, 0 = Stayed)

Requirements:
To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following packages:
•	numpy
•	pandas
•	scikit-learn
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
